# Console-App-
This is My first Console App created using Atom.In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a combination of a display                   monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair,                   which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output  from a computer or computer system.
