        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <p>Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js. It is written in CoffeeScript and Less.

Atom was released from beta, as version 1.0, on 25 June 2015. Its developers call it a "hackable text editor for the 21st Century". It is fully customizable in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Atom is a "hackable" text editor.
 This means it is customizable.
  There is an init script one can customize using CoffeeScript, a style sheet to customize the looks of Atom, and a keymap to map or re-map key combinations to commands.
  One can even make a package to wrap all of this functionality into a single package, written in their choice of CoffeeScript or JavaScript.
Atom was developed by GitHub as a text editor.
 Facebook then developed the Nuclide and Atom IDE projects to turn Atom into an integrated development environment (IDE), but development stopped in December 2018.
 Like most other configurable text editors, Atom enables users to install third-party packages and themes to customize the features and looks of the editor. Packages can be installed, managed and published via Atom's package manager apm. Syntactic highlighting support for other languages than the default, can be installed through the packages, as well as the auto-complete function.

             <p>In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a combination of a display
                  monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair,
                  which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output
                   from a computer or computer system.</p>
